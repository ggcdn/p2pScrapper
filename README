To start the attack:
1)Create the database with schema.sql 
2)Start fake.py as root
3)Start uTorrent as the announce server. (In "advanced" under preferences)
4)In uTorrent Force all outgoing connections to be encrypted. (In "BitTorrent" under preferences)
5)Change uTorrent's port to 3128 for urlsnarf's default. 
6)Create a torrent file and seed it with uTorrent.  
7)Open that .torrent file with p2pScraper's Python bittorrent client. 
Once the the .torrent file is opened,  a scrape request will be fired off and the database will be
populated with the proper infohash.  

It can take up to 10 minutes to trigger.  Usually it does it right away,  i'm not sure why.
